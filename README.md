## 🏗 Business Request & Approval Portal  
**SPFx Web Part | React | SharePoint Online**

### 📌 Context
Many teams rely on Power Automate for approvals. While effective, it can become slow, fragile, or costly for complex and high-volume workflows.

### 🚀 What I Built
A fully SharePoint-native approval portal using **SPFx + React**, featuring a custom client-side workflow engine to provide greater control, performance, and auditability.

### 🔥 Core Capabilities
- Multi-stage approval workflows (sequential & parallel)
- Config-driven approval matrix (editable without breaking in-flight requests)
- Conditional routing (e.g., Finance stage triggered by threshold amount)
- Out-of-office delegation with date windows
- SLA tracking with escalation logic
- Immutable audit trail for every workflow action
- HTML email notifications using SharePoint utilities

### ⚙ Technical Highlights
- SPFx 1.22 + React (TypeScript)
- Custom workflow engine (state-machine pattern)
- PnPjs v4 → SharePoint REST API (OData-optimized queries)
- Fully SharePoint-native (no Azure Functions, no service accounts)

> Designed to be fast, auditable, resilient, and enterprise-ready.

## 📊 SharePoint Quick Links Analytics Web Part  
**SPFx | React | Usage Analytics**

### 📌 What It Does
- Tracks intranet quick link usage (clicks & trends)
- Auto-sorts links based on real usage (7-day / 30-day rolling windows)
- Identifies unused or low-value links
- Admin configuration panel (no redeployment required)

### 💡 Why It’s Useful
- Improves intranet relevance dynamically
- Provides lightweight analytics without additional licensing
- Frequently deployed as a high-impact “quick win”

### ⚙ Technical Highlights
- SPFx 1.22 + React (TypeScript)
- PnPjs v4 with optimized REST batching
- Chart.js for analytics dashboards
- Responsive, modern UI architecture
- Configurable behavior via property pane

> Combines usability, performance, and measurable intranet impact.
